#basic knowledge

##when you start,import what you need
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(a,b,c)  
##define the domain of x ,a refer to the starting point ,b refer to the end point,
##c refer to how many points you want in the space

plt.figure(num=3,figsize(5,8)) 
##num:to number figures     figsize():to control the size of figures

plt.plot(x,y,color='red',linewidth=1.0,linestyle='--')
#to draw lines showing the relation between x and y,the latter is dependent variable

plt.show()
#to show the figure

plt.xlim(a,b)
plt.ylim(a,b)   ##set the range of the figure (it is different from 'linspace')
plt.xlabel('i am x')
plt.ylabel('i am y')    #label the axies

new_ticks = np.linspace(a,b,c)      ##set a new ticks of axies| a:the starting point,b:the end point,c:the number of segment you want
plt.xticks(new_ticks)       ##change the ticks of x axis
plt.yticks([0,1,2],
           [r'$bad$',r'$normal$',r'$good$'])
## change the ticks of y axis,the first line is 'ticks',teh second line is 'label' of 'ticks'
